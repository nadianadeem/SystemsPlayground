# Systems Playground

<p> A small, systems‑focused C++ engine prototype built to explore modern game‑engine architecture.
This project will include custom memory allocators, a lightweight job system, and the foundations of an open‑world streaming and simulation framework.
The goal is to develop a performant, data‑oriented runtime that mirrors the kind of low‑level systems work used in large‑scale games.</p>
