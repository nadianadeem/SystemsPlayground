# Systems Playground

[![Engine CI (MSBuild + GoogleTest)](https://github.com/nadianadeem/SystemsPlayground/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/nadianadeem/SystemsPlayground/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

<p> A small, systems‑focused C++ engine prototype built to explore modern game‑engine architecture.
This project will include custom memory allocators, a lightweight job system, and the foundations of an open‑world streaming and simulation framework.
The goal is to develop a performant, data‑oriented runtime that mirrors the kind of low‑level systems work used in large‑scale games.</p>

<p> This will go hand in hand with unit tests that will verify the confidence of the engine as well as performance profiling feature for applications made.</p>
