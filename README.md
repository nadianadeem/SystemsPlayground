# Systems Playground

[![Engine CI (MSBuild + GoogleTest)](https://github.com/nadianadeem/SystemsPlayground/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/nadianadeem/SystemsPlayground/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

<p> A small, systems‑focused C++ engine prototype built to explore modern game‑engine architecture.
This project will include custom memory allocators, a lightweight job system, and the foundations of an open‑world streaming and simulation framework.
The goal is to develop a performant, data‑oriented runtime that mirrors the kind of low‑level systems work used in large‑scale games.</p>

<p> This will go hand in hand with unit tests that will verify the confidence of the engine as well as performance profiling feature for applications made.</p>

# Plan
<p> 
Phase 1 — Renderer foundation (you’re here)
Quads, transforms, camera, grid.

Phase 2 — Renderer architecture
Meshes, materials, depth buffer, model transforms.

Phase 3 — Model loading
Load a simple car model + wheels.

Phase 4 — Physics integration
Rigidbodies, raycasts, wheel suspension, friction model.

Phase 5 — Vehicle simulation
- steering
- throttle/brake
- suspension
- tyre slip
- chassis roll/pitch
- All on a flat plane.

Phase 6 — Debug visualisation
- wheel contact points
- suspension lines
- velocity vectors
- centre of mass
- collision shapes

Phase 7 — Terrain
- Once the vehicle works, terrain becomes meaningful.</p>
